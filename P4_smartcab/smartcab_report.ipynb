    "## Implement a Basic Driving Agent\n",
    "To begin, your only task is to get the smartcab to move around in the environment. At this point, you will not be concerned with any sort of optimal driving policy. Note that the driving agent is given the following information at each intersection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next waypoint location relative to its current location and heading.\n",
    "- The state of the traffic light at the intersection and the presence of oncoming vehicles from other directions.\n",
    "- The current time left from the allotted deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this task, simply have your driving agent choose a random action from the set of possible actions (```None```,```'forward'```,```'left'```, ```'right'```) at each intersection, disregarding the input information above. Set the simulation deadline enforcement, ```enforce_deadline``` to ```False``` and observe how it performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION**: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?"

    "> The smartcab does not make it to the destination. Actions are being taken randomly so there is no learning of the beast actions to take and no policy is being applied. Hence there is no need to end up with the route, in average the smartcab gains more if it keeps on moving."

    "## Inform the Driving Agent\n",
    "Now that your driving agent is capable of moving around in the environment, your next task is to identify a set of states that are appropriate for modeling the smartcab and environment. The main source of state variables are the current inputs at the intersection, but not all may require representation. You may choose to explicitly define states, or use some combination of inputs as an implicit state. At each time step, process the inputs and update the agent's current state using the ```self.state``` variable. Continue with the simulation deadline enforcement ```enforce_deadline``` being set to ```False```, and observe how your driving agent now reports the change in state as the simulation progresses.\n",

    "## Implement a Q-Learning Driving Agent\n",
    "With your driving agent being capable of interpreting the input information and having a mapping of environmental states, your next task is to implement the Q-Learning algorithm for your driving agent to choose the best action at each time step, based on the Q-values for the current state and action. Each action taken by the smartcab will produce a reward which depends on the state of the environment. The Q-Learning driving agent will need to consider these rewards when updating the Q-values. Once implemented, set the simulation deadline enforcement enforce_deadline to True. Run the simulation and observe how the smartcab moves about the environment in each trial.\n",
